title: "raea/mesh"
summary: "Shapes and solids: Mesh3d and Mesh2d, Bevy's primitives, buffer meshes, instancing and exact solids."
order: 66
sources: ["sdk/raea/src/mesh.ts"]
---

`<Mesh3d>` holds a shape and a material, as Bevy's Mesh3d and MeshMaterial3d do. The shapes are Bevy's primitives
(`Cuboid`, `Sphere`, `Cylinder`, `Capsule3d`, `Cone`, `Torus`, `Plane3d` and the rest) with Bevy's fields.
`<BufferMesh>` takes your own vertices; `<Instances>` and `scatter` draw many copies at once; `Solid` builds exact
solids with booleans, for parts that must fit together.

```tsx
import { Cuboid, Mesh3d } from "raea/mesh";
import { StandardMaterial } from "raea/pbr";
import { Transform } from "raea/transform";

const Box = () => (
  <Mesh3d transform={Transform.fromXyz(0, 0.5, 0)}>
    <Cuboid half_size={[0.5, 0.5, 0.5]} />
    <StandardMaterial base_color="#4a7ae8" />
  </Mesh3d>
);
```

```ts
import { ATTRIBUTE_COLOR, ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL, ATTRIBUTE_POSITION, ATTRIBUTE_TANGENT } from "raea/mesh"
```

`raea/mesh` exports 14 components, 1 function, 2 classes, 10 values, 24 types. Bevy's counterpart: `bevy_mesh, bevy_shape`. Source: [sdk/raea/src/mesh.ts](https://github.com/shinyobjectz/raea/blob/main/sdk/raea/src/mesh.ts).

## Components

### `BufferMesh`

A mesh from its own vertex buffers, as the geometry of a <Mesh> (Bevy's Mesh built from attributes): a terrain from
a height field, a procedural shape, a ribbon, an imported point list. Drawn as flat triangles, or with indices and
normals as Bevy's indexed Mesh.

Bevy: `bevy_mesh::mesh::Mesh`.

Takes [`BufferMeshProps`](3d.md#buffermeshprops)'s props.

### `Capsule`

A capsule (Bevy's Capsule3d, three.js's CapsuleGeometry): [radius, length of the straight part], standing up
(along y); its whole height is length + 2 x radius. A character's stand-in, a pill, a collider's look.

Also takes the props of [`CapsuleProps`](3d.md#capsuleprops) (`args`).

### `Capsule3d`

*From Bevy's `bevy_shape::Capsule3d`:* A 3D capsule primitive centered on the origin A three-dimensional capsule is defined as a surface at a distance (radius) from a line

Bevy: `bevy_shape::Cone`.

Also takes the props of [`ConeProps`](3d.md#coneprops) (`args`, `radius`, `height`).

### `ConicalFrustum`

*From Bevy's `bevy_shape::ConicalFrustum`:* A conical frustum primitive. A conical frustum can be created by slicing off a section of a cone.

function scatter(o: ScatterOptions): Instance[]
```

### `Mesh3dProps`

The props of [`Mesh3d`](#mesh3d), tabled there.

### `MeshAttribute`

One attribute's values on a mesh: one a vertex, each a number or a list of the format's size.

```ts
type MeshAttribute = [MeshVertexAttribute, (number | number[])[]]
```

### `MeshSequenceProps`

| Field | Type | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | `string` | the entity's name, for picking and the inspector |
| `src` (required) | `string` | a.rseq (tools/goo writes them; raea_render::meshseq) |
| `frame` (required) | `number` | which of its frames (clamped) |
| `position` | `Vec3` | where it stands, metres (x, y, z) |
| `rotation` | `Vec3` | its rotation, Euler angles in radians (x, y, z) |

| `clearcoatRoughness` | `number` | 0..1 roughness of that clear layer |
| `reflectance` | `number` | 0..1 specular strength at normal incidence (0.5: 4%, a dielectric's) |
| `subsurface` | `number` | 0..1 light let through (diffuse transmission): a jelly's glow |
| `thickness` | `number` | how thick the mesh is, metres, for the light let through |
| `transmission` | `number` | 0..1 light let straight through and bent (a clear liquid: water, tea, juice), with its index of refraction (1.33 water) and, for a tinted one, the colour it takes after `attenuationDistance` metres through it. Screen space: it refracts what's on screen behind it, and one clear layer doesn't show another through it |
| `ior` | `number` | the index of refraction of what light passes through (1.33 water) |
| `attenuationColor` | `string` | the colour light takes after `attenuationDistance` metres through it |
| `attenuationDistance` | `number` | metres through it until light has taken `attenuationColor` |
| `opacity` | `number` | 0..1, see-through to solid |
| `map` | `string` | a picture over its texture coordinates |
| `doubleSided` | `boolean` | draw the back faces too (an open shell, a petal) |

### `PlanBox`

A box on the plan (x, z, metres): the room SDK's Footprint, or any { min, max }.

| Field | Type | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `min` (required) | `[number, number]` | the low corner (x, z), metres |
| `max` (required) | `[number, number]` | the high corner (x, z), metres |

### `Plane3dProps`

Bevy's Plane3d: a flat rectangle facing `normal` (Bevy's default +Y, a floor), `half_size` its half extent along
its two axes ([0.5, 0.5]), laid out as Bevy's PlaneMeshBuilder does: facing +Z it is a Plane of args
[2 x half_size]. The normal is along an axis; a tilted plane is a rotated Mesh3d.

| Field | Type | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `normal` | `Vec3` | the way it faces, along an axis (+Y by default, a floor) |
| `half_size` | `[number, number]` | half its extent along its two axes, metres ([0.5, 0.5]) |

### `Polygons`

A 2D outline: contours of [x, y] points (counter-clockwise for solid, clockwise for a hole).

```ts
type Polygons = [number, number][][]
```

### `ScatterOptions`

| Field | Type | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `area` (required) | `PlanBox` | where the points fall: a box on the plan (x, z) |
| `count` (required) | `number` | how many (fewer when the area fills up: spacing and avoid leave no room) |
| `spacing` | `number` | the least distance between two points, metres (0: none) |
| `avoid` | `PlanBox[]` | boxes on the plan to keep clear of, grown by `margin` |
| `margin` | `number` | how far to stay off each avoided box (spacing / 2 by default) |
| `clearOf` | `Instance[]` | points kept off already-placed ones too: a second scatter (flowers) clear of the first (stones) by `spacing` |
| `seed` | `number` | 1 by default; the same seed gives the same points, every frame, render and play |
| `yaw` | `boolean \| number \| [number, number]` | each point's turn about y (radians): true (the default) any, false none, a number that one, [lo, hi] between |
| `tilt` | `number` | a lean off upright, radians: each point tipped by up to this much in a random direction (0 by default) |
| `scale` | `number \| [number, number]` | a scale, or [lo, hi] between (uniform) |
| `y` | `number \| ((x: number, z: number) => number)` | the ground's height: a number (0), or the terrain's height at (x, z) |
| `density` | `(x: number, z: number) => number` | how likely a point is kept at (x, z), 0 to 1: a density map (a path worn bare, a patch thicker by the chair) |

### `Section`

A cross-section of a solid at a height: its area, how many contours, and the contours themselves.

subdivisions, or `ico` of them (Bevy's `.ico(n)`, 0 to 80), or a UV sphere of `uv` = [sectors, stacks] (`.uv(s, t)`).

| Field | Type | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `args` | `[number]` | [radius], as three.js's args |
| `radius` | `number` | metres (0.5) |
| `ico` | `number` | an icosphere of this many subdivisions (5 by default; 0 to 80) |
| `uv` | `[number, number]` | a UV sphere instead: [sectors, stacks] |

### `TorusProps`

type Vec3 = [number, number, number]
```

### `VertexFormat`

A vertex attribute's format, as Bevy's VertexFormat names it.

```ts
type VertexFormat = "Float32" | "Float32x2" | "Float32x3" | "Float32x4" | "Uint32" | "Uint32x2" | "Uint32x3" | "Uint32x4" | "Sint32" | "Sint32x4"
```
