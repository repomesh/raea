// raea: React components and hooks for time. This slice is the pure TypeScript and React part; drawing to
// pixels is the renderer's job (Bevy, through a Clock per frame).
// This entry runs inside the engine's V8, so it imports nothing beyond React; renderFrame is in ./test.
// CSS the page draws that csstype doesn't type yet, typed as raea's own (its import puts the augmentation in the program)
